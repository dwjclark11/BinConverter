# BinConverter
Simple GUI application that will take in a binary files such as a PNG, JPG, WAV, MP3, etc, and convert the 
binary file into a lua table or a C-Style array. 

It uses [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for the user interface, [NativeFileDialog-Extended](https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended) for 
opening the necessary file dialogs. It also uses [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) for windowing and processing events.
